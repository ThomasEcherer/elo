<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>ECM systems such as ELO are designed to serve as a central database for effectively managing all company processes and information.A large network of partners and ELO consultants develop solutions that are tailored to individual customer requirements. ELO systems and processes are as individual as the companies that use them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, solutions scenarios are essentially similar. For example, the process for recording invoices and processing invoice data is basically the same in most companies. <span
style='font-weight:bold;font-style:italic'>ELO Business Solutions</span> use best practice approaches that help to define a common standard. This enables customers to benefit from the experiences of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past ELO sample solutions clearly illustrated how ELO application expertise are intertwined with the business knowledge of all employees.<span
style='font-style:italic'> ELO Business Solutions</span> build on this concept and bring competitive solutions to market that are based on established standard software of the individual specialist departments. The specially configured dashboards and application views in the solutions are based on state-of-the-art web technologies and usability findings that offer users convenient ways to handle daily tasks with ELO. In addition, offering a wide range of solutions will help ELO tap new markets. Each ELO Business Solution also comes with extensive documentation of the business processes. Simple installation and configuration options make for faster results and increases the quality of projects thanks to established concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the invoice processing solution <span

<p>The solutions also support the ELO multi-client strategy in order to provide the same functions in the Java Client and the Web Client as far as is possible.</p>
