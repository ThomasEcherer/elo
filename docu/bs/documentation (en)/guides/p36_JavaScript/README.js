Originally developed for dynamic HTML pages, JavaScript is now increasingly used for more complex web applications and application containers such as <span\nstyle='font-style:italic'>node.js</span>. </p>\n\n\n<p>A core language standardized as <span\nstyle='font-style:italic'>ECMAScript</span> describes a classless object oriented language. Unlike object relational programming languages such as C# or Java, this is classless and dynamically typified. Similar to the syntax in Java, inheritance mechanisms in JavaScript are not realized using classes but using prototypes.</p>\n\n\n<p>To offer Javascript as the scripting language for extending ELO components such as the <span\nstyle='font-style:italic'>ELO Indexserver</span> or <span style='font-style:\nitalic'>ELOas</span>, the Open Source project <a\nhref=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Rhino\"><span style='font-style:\nitalic'>Rhino</span></a> is embedded as the runtime environment. </p>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"tag_caution\"><span\nstyle='font-weight:bold'>Sound knowledge of JavaScript is required for developing and adding extensions to ELO Business Solutions. </span></span></p>\n\n\n<p>JavaScript tutorials can be found at <a\nhref=\"https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript\">Code Academy</a>.</p>\n\n","title":"JavaScript"});
