<h1> JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is always used when adapting ELO components (Java Client, AS, IX, ...) and when developing ELO apps. Originally developed for dynamic HTML pages, JavaScript is now increasingly used for more complex web applications and application containers such as <span
style='font-style:italic'>node.js</span>. </p>
<p>A core language standardized as <span
style='font-style:italic'>ECMAScript</span> describes a classless object oriented language. Unlike object relational programming languages such as C# or Java, this is classless and dynamically typified. Similar to the syntax in Java, inheritance mechanisms in JavaScript are not realized using classes but using prototypes.</p>
<p>To offer Javascript as the scripting language for extending ELO components such as the <span
style='font-style:italic'>ELO Indexserver</span> or <span style='font-style:
italic'>ELOas</span>, the Open Source project <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Rhino"><span style='font-style:
italic'>Rhino</span></a> is embedded as the runtime environment. </p>
<p><span class="tag_caution"><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Sound knowledge of JavaScript is required for developing and adding extensions to ELO Business Solutions. </span></span></p>
