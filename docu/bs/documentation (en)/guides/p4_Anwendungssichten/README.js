The ELO clients provide excellent user experience based on intense research in the field of ECM. If you look at solutions such as ticket systems, these consist of special applications that are adapted for the specific usage scenario in order to provide the user with easier access to functions. ELO apps serve to close this gap.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id='p4_Anwendungssichten-section-aggregation-of-information'>Aggregation of information</h2>\n\n\n<p>As solutions map complex business processes, the application views should support the user as best as possible. To this end, reports and analysis views are used to merge information from different areas for the purpose of evaluation. Object views are used to help deliver an optimal view of objects for the specific usage scenario.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span\nstyle='font-weight:bold;font-style:italic'>Example:</span><span\nstyle='font-style:italic'> In public administration, individual cases such as damage notifications are combined into files. Due to the specific requirements for ad hoc control of cases, a special object view was created. Further analysis views provide the user with additional information such as an overview of all the cases that were created as well as their current status.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p>It is better to present information in a hierarchical nested structure because the information can become more detailed the further down you navigate. The top levels therefore represent an increasingly aggregated view of information. This form of structuring lets the user get information quickly as the user does not require knowledge of how much information is available. On a project management portal, for example, the aggregation of information would increase starting from a detailed list of steps in a work package through visualizing a project and the overview page of all projects.</p>\n\n\n<p><p><img src=\"guides/p4_Anwendungssichten/img1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"594\" height=\"292\"></p></p>\n\n\n<p>This aggregation is the same in the ELO repository structure, with the exception of dashboards.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id='p4_Anwendungssichten-section-responsive-design'>Responsive design</h2>\n\n\n<p><span\nstyle='font-style:italic'>Responsive design</span> is a paradigm of web development that responds to the different requirements of the devices used. This includes adapting applications to the size of the screen, for example, or customizing the navigation options or images.</p>\n\n\n<p><p><img src=\"guides/p4_Anwendungssichten/img3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"282\"></p></p>\n\n\n<p>The objective of ELO apps is to provide different user groups with the best possible interface, regardless of whether they use them in mobile environments, in the ELO Web Client or in the ELO Java Client. All the interfaces should conform to the principles of modern web development.</p>\n\n","title":"Application views"});
