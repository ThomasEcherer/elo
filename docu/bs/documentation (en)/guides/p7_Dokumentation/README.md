<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Solution documentation serves to inform the different user groups about</p>
<ul>
<li>the business concepts and best practice approaches implemented</li>
<li>available customization options</li>
<li>deployment options</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable different user groups to get to grips with the solutions quickly, the documentation is structured according to separate topics.</p>
<table><thead><tr><td><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Area</span></td><td><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Description</span></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span
style='font-weight:bold'>API</span></td><td>The API documentation is designed for project developers who customize solutions and implement extensions based on existing Business Solutions technologies. This is where you find all underlying JS classes and have direct access to the implementation based on the source code.</td></tr><tr><td><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Documentation</span></td><td>The documentation consists of different views, starting with the description of the processes from a business perspective (best practice) and function based on use cases. The documentation also contains notes on implementation as well as customization options. References to the corresponding API documentation enable companies to coordinate the business-related requirements with the project developers responsible.</td></tr><tr><td><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Videos</span></td><td>Videos offer a general overview of the implemented solution and explain more complex concepts using examples.</td></tr><tr><td><span
style='font-weight:bold'>Installation</span></td><td>The installation guide shows you options for installing the solution in just a few clicks and explains steps that need to be taken downstream. This is helpful for installing in projects or for setting up presentation environments.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2>Versions of a solution</h2>
<p>ELO Business Solutions are under continuous development. The title/name of the respective solution indicates which version you are currently using.</p>
<p>{@img img5.png}</p>
<p>API, documentation, videos and installation correspond to the selected version.</p>
<h2>API documentation</h2>
<p>Thanks to an extended class model based on JavaScript, it is possible to map inheritance mechanisms in an interactive documentation. For example, you can see the inheritance hierarchy including all required classes and links to the relevant JS files on the right-hand side.</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>The challenge is to combine business-relevant and technical information on one page. For this reason, the documentation topics should be structured from a business viewpoint followed by a technical explanation.</p>
<p>{@img img9.png}</p>
<p>A filing plan, for example, could be described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition of the filing plan</li>
<li>Structure</li>
<li>Filing plan reference (creation and allocation)</li>
<li>Keywording forms</li>
<li>Inheritance of file metadata</li>
</ol>
<p>This roughly corresponds to the chronological order: </p>
<ol>
<li>Business concept</li>
<li>Technical concept</li>
<li>Technical implementation </li>
<li>Remarks on customizing</li>
</ol>
